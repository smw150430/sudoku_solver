# sudoku_solver

Within the jupyter notebook, you may define a variable grid that is a list of lists where each nested list represents a row of the sudoku puzzle.  The zeroes represent empty places.  

The possible function returns True if the argument specified is a valid entry for that empty spot, i.e., not in violation of the rules of the game and False otherwise.
